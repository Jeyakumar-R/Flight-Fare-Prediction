# Flight-Fare-Prediction with deployment using streamlit

### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline etc !

### This was my final year mini project !

The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle, and it is a time-stamped dataset so, while building the model, extensive pre-processing was done on the 
dataset especially on the date-time columns to finally come up with a ML model which could effectively predict airline fares across various Indian Cities. 
The dataset had many features which had to pre-processed and transformed into new parameters for a cleaner and simple web application layout to predict the fares. 

The various independent features in the dataset were: 

Airline: The name of the airline.

Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey

Source: The source from which the service begins.

Destination: The destination where the service ends.

Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.

Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.

Duration: Total duration of the flight.

Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.

Price: The price of the ticket
